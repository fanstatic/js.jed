Introduction
============

This library packages `Jed`_ for `fanstatic`_.

.. _`fanstatic`: http://fanstatic.org
.. _`Jed`: https://slexaxton.github.io/Jed/

This requires integration between your web framework and ``fanstatic``,
and making sure that the original resources (shipped in the ``resources``
directory in ``js.jed``) are published to some URL.
